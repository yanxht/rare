Title: Linear Model with Tree-Based Lasso Regularization 
       for Rare Features
Version: 0.1.1
Author: Xiaohan Yan [aut, cre], Jacob Bien [aut, cre]
Maintainer: Xiaohan Yan <xy257@cornell.edu>
Description: Implementation of an alternating direction method of multipliers
    algorithm for fitting a linear model with tree-based lasso regularization, 
    which is proposed in Algorithm 1 of Yan and Bien (2018) <arXiv:1803.06675>. 
    The package allows efficient model fitting on the entire 2-dimensional 
    regularization path for large datasets. The complete set of functions 
    also makes the entire process of tuning regularization parameters and 
    visualizing results hassle-free.
